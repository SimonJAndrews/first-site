    <h3 class="heading">Lasagne</h3>

    <p>Lasagne is a classic Italian al forno dish that generally consists of alternating layers of pasta sheets and various fillings, including - though not exclusively - ragù, besciamella and cheese, such as mozzarella, ricotta or Parmesan. 
        Typically, this assembled dish is then baked in an oven until piping hot and all the cheese has melted. </p>

            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
            <li>50g Parmesan, grated</li>
            <li>150g pack mozzarella, shredded</li>
            <li>50g butter</li>
            <li>50g plain flour</li>
            <li>550ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading">How to......</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, 
                or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the 
                wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire
                sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour.
                Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk 
                until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a 
                third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and
                mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
